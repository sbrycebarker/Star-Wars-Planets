# Star Wars Planets
This project was built for DevMountain immersive bootcamp. 
 
## This project uses 

  * AgularJs 
  * Javascript 
  * HTML5
  * CSS3
  * Swapi.co
  * Openweathermap

The app uses Swapi.co for the information on the planets and it uses an openweathermap weather information that fits each planet. Each planet gets weather updates from an area of the Earth that is similar to its own climate. Rome for Courisant, Cairo for Tatooine etc.
